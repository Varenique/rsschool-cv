## Characteristics and Aims:  

It's very important to constantly develop and gain new knowledge,  
because this is the only way to achieve success. Since I'm a  
Junior Developer, it's important for me to get experience from  
those, who can share it. The purpose of my participation in the  
courses is to learn new concepts, languages and direction, that  
I have not been involved in before. In turn, I can say, that I'm  
ready to responsibly approach the study of material and practice.  
Each time I complete a task, that I have never encountered before,  
I get a huge amount of motivation to continue my way.
